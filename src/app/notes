The Complaints Report Management System is a simple project that can serve as the website of the police department to provide the 
citizens under their jurisdiction an online platform for their complaints, possible crime report, or any incident that may occur 
in their city or municipal. The system requires the complainant to register to the system so they can submit a complaint using 
the website.
